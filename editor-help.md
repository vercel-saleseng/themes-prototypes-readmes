# Welcome to the Theme Editor
This template allows you create a theme for shadcn that can be used to mock your design system or add some flair to your v0 generations! The themes are stored in a database and are synced with any chat based off of the [Theme Starter template](https://v0.dev/community/theme-starter-Mr35zbgRwjc). 

## Instructions
1. When prompted, [add a blob store integration with your chat.](https://v0.dev/docs/databases) 
2. Once the blob store has been connected, make note of the name of the blob store the chat is connected to. You can find the name of the blob by visiting the project settings, navigating to the integrations tab, and clicking the ‘Manage’ button on the blob integration.
3. Go ahead and use the visual editor start customizing your theme! When you are happy with your theme, go ahead and save your changes to the database by clicking 'Save' button on the top right. 
4. Follow the instructions from the [Theme Starter](https://v0.dev/community/theme-starter-Mr35zbgRwjc) to begin using your theme in future v0 chats!
