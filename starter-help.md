# Welcome to the Theme Starter
This template allows v0 to use a predefined theme created from the [Theme Editor](https://v0.dev/community/theme-editor-mJ213GxiejJ) in its generations. If you have not created a theme using the editor, please start there!

## Instructions
1. In the [Theme Editor](https://v0.dev/community/theme-editor-mJ213GxiejJ), make note of the name of the blob store the chat is connected to. You can find the name of the blob by visiting the project settings, navigating to the integrations tab, and clicking the 'Manage' button on the blob integration.
2. When prompted to connect a blob to the chat, click the dropdown next to the 'Create' button and select the name of the blob you saw earlier. DO  NOT click the 'Create' button, only the dropdown! Once connected, you should see a checkmark below confirming the connection to the theme.
3. In the code tab, lock the theme-consumer folder.
4. Go ahead and begin prompting. v0 will replace this page and begin bringing your ideas to life. Happy prototyping!

## Troubleshooting
If you accidentally connected the wrong blob store, you will need to visit the v0 project settings and:
1. Clear out the environment variables connected to the existing blob store.
2. Remove the project integration in the Vercel dashboard.
